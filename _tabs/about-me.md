Hello there! 🙂\
My name is **Sasha Legrand**. I'm a 24-year-old programming enthusiast, currently a student at [**Isart Digital Paris**](https://www.isart.fr/) as a **Game Developer**.

## **My Journey**
---

### 🎮 *The Awakening*
I was born the *24th June 1999* at la [Seyne-Sur-Mer](https://www.google.com/maps/place/83500+La+Seyne-sur-Mer/@43.0837671,5.83768,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x12c9034047a1d23b:0x40819a5fd8fc8e0!8m2!3d43.102976!4d5.878219!16zL20vMDV6dzhw?entry=ttu) where I took my first steps.\
Introverted and a homebody, I discovered my love of ***Video Games*** mainly thanks to my dad who was a great player in those days. 
**Nintendo 64**, **DS**, **Wii**, **Xbox 360** (not a *PlayStation* hater, I have my own **PS5** now 😉), and the better one **PC**, a bunch of consoles
that enlighten my days and made me a great player too (I hope so 🧐).

### 🕵️‍♂️ *The Discovery*
My passion for programming was not clear at this time. I was a player but I never think about being a key factor in the game development.

I started studying in an [economic and social](https://www.langevin-la-seyne.fr/index.php/enseignement/baccalaureat-general.html) training course. That has been really useful for me as it allows me to become more mature and develop my social skills. Farewell to the homebody and welcome to the friend lover and the night owl ✨🦉.

But in a professional context, I was not satisfied so I jumped into an [electronic and IT](https://iut.univ-tln.fr/-Departement-Genie-Electrique-et-Informatique-Industrielle-GEII-.html) technical university diploma where I finally **discover** the love of programming.

### 🧮 *The Decision*

There, I was faced with the choice of continuing in an industrial sector or developed my programming skills elsewhere. That brought me to the idea to mix my passion of programming with my passion of video games. I saw myself as the creator of tomorrow's games. Being able to work on game franchises that I grew up with, and to give others the opportunity to enjoy them as I did, it became my dream.

And so, after a long search I finally went to [**Isart Digital Paris**](https://www.isart.fr/), a video games and 3D animation school where I'm currently doing a **Game Programming** formation.

### 💻 *The Present*

My **Game Programming** classes have led me to take part in a variety of projects. From **game creation** to **modular tool** design, I developed my programming skills and learned all the steps involved in designing a game.\
Also, through the projects carried out I was led to work with different branches of the industry like *Game Designers*, *Game Artists*, *Sound Designers* and *Producers*.

Today, I'm in my 4th year of programming at [**Isart Digital**](https://www.isart.fr/) with an ever-growing passion. Next to this, I have an internship with [**Ikigai: Games For Citizens**](https://www.gfc.ikigai.games/) where my job is to help on creating educational games, making them tools to make development easier and implementing gameplay bricks.

### 🤔 *The Continuity*

My current experience at *Ikigai: Games For Citizens* allowed me to strengthen my hard and soft skills through participation in commited and successful projects. But today, I want to evolve and use those skills to be part of more innovative and impactful projects.

My primary goal is to find a professional contract to complete my two last years at *Isart Digital*. I want to diversify my experiences, try my hand at bigger companies and be entrusted with greater responsibilities.

## **My Hobbies**
---

Music 🎹
: One of the most important thing in my life, just ***Music***. I listen to it every day. Going through all the styles depending on the situation, it helps me to stay focus and stay with me through my ups and downs. I also play **guitar** 🎸 and **piano** 🎹, which I teach myself and I really want to create my own music when I could devote more time to it.

Sport 🧗
: I love climbing. More often in climbing gyms by simplicity but I also like it outdoors on mountain slopes.\
I also skate 🛹 with friends.

Hiking 🥾
: Take your bag and your pair of shoes, be ready to walk and discover incredible and breathtaking landscapes. I'm lucky to be in France and to be able to walk in all the mountain ranges it has to offer. Going alone or with friends, that helps me to change my mind and breathe fresh air. Look below some photos I was able to take.
